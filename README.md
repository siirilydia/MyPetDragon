# MyPetDragon

This was our 3-day group project after studying C#.NET for one month (plus one month of pre-studying at home) at Academy.

Please note that everything in the game and the code itself is written in finnish.

We ended up with a rather interesting result where we have a winforms-app and a console app in the same game.
Afterwards we did realize that we could have done the "search for food"-minigame in a textbox as well, instead of the console.
But it works and we learned something new, so maybe that is the most important thing right now.

Please also note that your console font needs to be changed to Lucida Console for the heart-pattern to appear
on your trail in the minigame. The game will work without it as well, the trail of hearts just brings a tiny bit
of extra cuteness to it.

Overall this was a fun project to do. It also made me realize that I want to work in the game industry.
